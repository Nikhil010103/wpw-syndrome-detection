# wpw-syndrome-detection
This project aims to develop a deep learning-based approach for accurately detecting Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome from ECG images. WPW syndrome is a cardiac condition caused by an abnormal extra electrical pathway in the heart, which can lead to episodes of rapid heart rate (tachycardia).

Project Overview
ðŸ”¹ Objective: Build an AI-powered model for automated WPW detection using ECG images.
ðŸ”¹ Approach:

Preprocess ECG images to enhance model interpretability.
Train a deep learning model on a labeled dataset.
Evaluate performance using key classification metrics.
ðŸ”¹ Impact: This model aims to assist healthcare professionals in the early detection and diagnosis of WPW syndrome, enabling timely medical intervention and improved patient outcomes.
Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation was sourced from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/code/bjoernjostein/wpw-detection-from-ecg-using-1d-cnn/notebook#Wolff-Parkinson-White-prediction-using-1D-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
