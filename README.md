# wpw-syndrome-detection
This project focuses on developing a deep learning model to accurately detect Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome from ECG images. WPW syndrome is a heart condition caused by an abnormal extra electrical pathway, which can lead to episodes of rapid heart rate (tachycardia). The goal of this project is to create an AI-driven diagnostic tool that can assist healthcare professionals in the early detection and diagnosis of WPW syndrome, enabling timely medical intervention.

The project involves preprocessing ECG images to improve model interpretability, training a deep learning model on a labeled dataset, and evaluating its performance using standard classification metrics. By leveraging deep learning techniques, this approach aims to provide a reliable, efficient, and automated method for identifying WPW syndrome.
The dataset used for training and evaluation was sourced from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/code/bjoernjostein/wpw-detection-from-ecg-using-1d-cnn/notebook#Wolff-Parkinson-White-prediction-using-1D-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
